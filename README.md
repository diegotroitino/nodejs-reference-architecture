# nodejs-reference-architecture

It's a personal NodeJS reference architecture that explores many packages and pattenrs with samples. The aim is not to be a recomendation nor to indicate the best package or pattern. 

Subprojects will explore specific dependencies and implementations as simple as poss√≠ble to provide a reference to be used in future projects. They can also be used to compare diferent solutions to the same problem.
